## Custom Web Design and Development for SEO
I have helped design, edit, and build new websites for clients for the past 15 years.
I am experienced with HTML5/CSS3, and several JS frameworks. In recent years I have focused more on React, Gatsby, and Astro JS frameworks for their performance benefits (server/client side-rendering, SPAs, PWAs)
This site and my previous site source code are available on my [Github](https://github.com/jeredhiggins)

only the best pages that satisfy visitor intent exist on the domain.
3. **Data-First Approach**: Creating unique landing pages and experiences for visitors based on relevant and actionable data insights.
4. **Mobile-Friendly Design**: Optimizing mobile experience with mobile-friendly and responsive design best practices.


**Custom SEO Web Development**

1. **Semantic HTML**: Using semantic HTML elements, such as `<header>`, `<nav>`, `<main>`, `<h1>`, `<h2>`
and `<footer>`, to improve website organization and accessibility.
2. **Alt Text for Images**: Adding alt text to images to provide a textual description of
the image for search engines and screen readers.
3. **Optimized Image Compression**: Optimizing image compression using techniques like image
sprites or lazy loading.
4. **Page Speed Optimization**: Optimizing page speed by minimizing JavaScript file size,
reducing the number of requests, using server-side rendering, pre-rendering, and utilizing caching appropriately.
5. **Accessibility-Compliant Code**: Writing accessibility-compliant code that follows Web
Content Accessibility Guidelines and the latest attributes such as `aria-label` and `aria-description`
8. **Server-Side Rendering**: Using server-side rendering to pre-render pages on the server,
reducing JavaScript dependencies and improving page speed.
9. **Canonical URLs**: Implementing canonical URLs to prevent duplicate content issues and
specify a preferred version of a URL.
10. **Robots.txt and Sitemap.xml**: Creating a custom `robots.txt` file to control how search
engines crawl your website and a `sitemap.xml` file to help search engines understand your
website's structure and the most important pages on your site.
11. **Schema Markup**: Adding schema markup to provide additional context for search engines
about your website's content/structure and capturing additional SERP (search engine result page) real estate by including
relevant structured data markup that benefits from SERP features such as featured snippets, Google SGE overview, Google SGE answer
box, etc. 
12. **Content is Visible in Rendered DOM**: Ensure that your website's content is visible in the rendered DOM (Document Object Model). 
This important step in the rendering process ensures that search engines can crawl and index your site content effectively.
13. **Optimized Critical Rendering Path**: The Critical Rendering Path is the sequence of steps the browser goes through to convert the HTML, CSS, and JavaScript into pixels on the screen. 
Optimizing the critical render path improves render performance and ensures important content is rendered first.
14. **Internal Linking**: Internal linking recommendations to ensure important pages are accessible to both visitors and
search engines.
