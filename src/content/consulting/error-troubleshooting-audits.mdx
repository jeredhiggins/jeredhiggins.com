I help clients identify, prioritize, and resolve Technical SEO
issues at scale, optimize their website's performance, and improve their online visibility via comprehensive audits.

## Website Error and Troubleshooting Services:

1. **Error Identification**: Identifying Technical SEO errors on a website, including HTTP status codes
(4xx, 5xx, and 3xx redirect chains/loops), JavaScript errors, `rel=canonical` issues, Crawl waste/bloat, Indexing issues,
and Rendering issues.
2. **Root Cause Analysis**: Analyzing the root cause of errors, such as rendering issues, broken links.
3. **Error Resolution**: Resolving errors by adjusting code, suggesting changes to page templates/HTML, or
updating server software.
4. **Page Speed Optimization**: Optimizing page load times by identifying and resolving
render-blocking resources, minifying code, and optimizing images.
5. **Mobile-Friendliness Testing**: Conducting mobile-friendliness tests to ensure website
content is accessible and usable on various devices.
6. **Website Crawlability Assessment**: Assessing a website's crawlability by analyzing
sitemaps, robots.txt files, and crawl errors.
7. **XML Sitemap Analysis**: Analyzing XML sitemaps for errors, inconsistencies, or missing
URLs.
8. **Robots.txt File Analysis**: Analyzing robots.txt files for errors, inconsistencies, or
blocked URLs.
9. **Meta Tag Review**: Reviewing meta tags (titles, descriptions) for accuracy,
relevance, and optimization opportunities.
5. **Canonical URL Assessment**: Assessing canonical URLs to ensure they are properly
configured and not causing duplicate content issues.
6. **Internal Link Analysis**: Analyzing internal links to identify orphaned pages, broken
links, or opportunities for link equity transfer.
8. **Image Compression and Optimization**: Compressing and optimizing images to reduce file
sizes and improve page load times.
8. **Log File Analysis**: Analyze site log data to identify:
	* Your most important pages are being crawled
    * Crawl Budget/Allocation - How often your most important pages are being crawled
	* Crawl Behavior - How Googlebot and other search engine user agents crawl your website
    * Crawl Waste - Identify low quality and irrelevant pages that waste search engine resources such as indexable/crawlable URL's 
    with unnecessary parameters `example.com/product?color=red&size=32`
    * Unusual Crawl Patterns - Sudden changes, like significant increases or drops, in crawler activity
