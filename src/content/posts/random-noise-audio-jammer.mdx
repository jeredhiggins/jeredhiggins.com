## Example:

## Purpose and Background:
Make an affordable and portable random noise generator for counter-surveillance/privacy
With the increasing amount of new surveillance systems, wide use of surveillance devices/software, and lack of tools/resources/education on privacy issues - why not try to maintain some amount of privacy?

### Code:
I used some example code in public domain with a small tweak to generate a tone out that relies on the sensor reading. Adjust the settings to find a sound that isn't too annoying. See code and instructions below:

```c++
int outputPin = 9;

void setup() 
{
  // initialize serial communications (for debugging only):
  Serial.begin(9600);
}

void loop() {
  // read the sensor:
  int sensorReading = analogRead(A0);
  // map the analog input range (400 - 1000 from the photoresistor)
  // to the output pitch range (120 - 1500Hz)
  int thisPitch = map(sensorReading, 400, 1000, 120, 1500);
  // play the pitch:
  tone(outputPin, thisPitch, 10);
  // delay in between reads for stability
  delay(1);        
}
```
